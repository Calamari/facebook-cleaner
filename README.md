# Facebook cleaner

This is a command line script written in ruby that lets you delete all the years from your Facebook. So you can delete all the old content, but not the last one.

For this it uses the facebook mobile page, because it just doesn't have Javascript und presents the last amount of confirmation dialogs, which are stepped through using selenium webdriver.

## Usage

```sh
bundle
ruby rub.rb
```
